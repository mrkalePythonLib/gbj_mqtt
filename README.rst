Purpose of the package
**********************

The package ``gbj_mqtt`` contains just one module ``mqtt`` with constants,
functions, and methods for processing MQTT messages by MQTT clients.

- The package is treated as a git submodule and is usually involved into other
  Python packages as a sub-package.

- In either case the package can be installed individually as a standalone
  Python package.
